# Dockge

A fancy, easy-to-use and reactive docker stack (`docker-compose.yml`) manager.

## ⭐ Features

- Focus on `docker-compose.yml` stack management
- Interactive editor for `docker-compose.yml`
- Interactive web terminal for containers and any docker commands
- Reactive - Everything is just responsive. Progress and terminal output are in real-time
- Easy-to-use & fancy UI - If you love Uptime Kuma's UI/UX, you will love this too
- Build on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/), as known as `compose.yaml` and `docker compose`
- Convert `docker run ...` command into `docker-compose.yml` file

## Installation

## Motivations

- I have been using Portainer for some time, but I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.
- Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript (Originally, I planned to use Deno or Bun.js, but they do not support for arm64, so I stepped back to Node.js)


If you love this project, please consider giving this project a ⭐.
