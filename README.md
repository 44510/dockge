## üîß How to Install

1. Create a directory `dockge`
2. Create or download [`compose.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louislam/dockge/master/compose.yaml) and put it inside `dockge`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  dockge:
    image: louislam/dockge:nightly
    ports:
      - 5001:5001
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```
3. `docker-compose up -d`

Dockge is now running on http://localhost:5001

## Motivations

- I have been using Portainer for some time, but for the stack management, I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I try to deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.
- Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript (Originally, I planned to use Deno or Bun.js, but they do not support for arm64, so I stepped back to Node.js)

If you love this project, please consider giving this project a ‚≠ê.


## FAQ

#### "Dockge"?

"Dockge" is a coinage word which is created by myself. I hope it sounds like `Badge` but replacing with `Dock` - `Dock-ge`.

The naming idea was coming from Twitch emotes like `sadge`, `bedge` or `wokege`. They are all ending with `-ge`.

If you are not comfortable with the pronunciation, you can call it `Dockage`

## More Ideas?

- Stats
- File manager
- App store for yaml templates
- Get app icons
- Switch Docker context
- Support Dockerfile and build
- Support Docker swarm


# Others

Dockge is built on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/). `compose.yaml`  is also known as `docker-compose.yml`.
