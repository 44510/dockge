# Dockge

A fancy, easy-to-use and reactive docker stack (`docker-compose.yml`) manager.

## ⭐ Features

- Focus on `docker-compose.yml` stack management
- Interactive editor for `docker-compose.yml` files
- Interactive web terminal for containers and any docker commands
- Reactive - Everything is just responsive. Progress and terminal output are in real-time
- Easy-to-use & fancy UI - If you love Uptime Kuma's UI, you will love this too

## Installation

## Motivations

- Try ES Module and TypeScript in 2023
- I have been using Portainer for some time, but I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I deploy a stack, it keeps spinning the loading icon for a few minutes, and I don't know what's going on.

If you love this project, please consider giving this project a ⭐.
