# Dockge

## Features

- Easy-to-use
- Fancy UI
- Focus on `docker-compose` stack management
- Interactive editor for `docker-compose.yml` files
- Easy to expose your service to the internet with https


## Motivations

- Want to build my dream web-based container manager
- Want to try next gen runtime like Deno or Bun, but I chose Deno because at this moment, Deno is more stable and Jetbrains IDE support is better.
- Full TypeScript and ES module
- Try DaisyUI + TailwindCSS

## Dockge?

Naming idea is coming from Twitch emotes. There are many emotes sound like this such as `bedge` and `sadge`.
